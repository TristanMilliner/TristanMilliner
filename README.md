### Introduce Myself
***
Hi, Iâ€™m @TristanMilliner. I am currently a 3rd year computer science student at ubo in brest.
I studied in a prepa MP from 2018 to 2020 where I started to learn programming in Python. I worked on databases too.
Then, after these two years, I decided to work on this way rather than in mathematics. 
That's how I really discovered the computer science. I went in second years at university to learn from bases.
And I'm still learning everyday since those days...
